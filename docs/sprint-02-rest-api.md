# Sprint 02: REST API Implementation

## 🎯 Goal
Develop the core business logic for the microservices and expose RESTful endpoints.

## ✅ Delivered
- [x] **Task Service**: CRUD operations for tasks.
- [x] **User Service**: User profile management.
- [x] **Notification Service**: Mock email/SMS endpoints.
- [x] Unit tests with JUnit 5 and RestAssured.

## 🔌 API Design
All services follow REST principles and return JSON responses.
